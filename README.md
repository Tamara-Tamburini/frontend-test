# Front-end Test

This SPA lists in the main view mobile devices obtained through an API. Clicking on any of the listed devices shows another view detailing the device information, giving the option to add it to the shopping cart.

To enables the navigation among views I have used the library React Router.

For the layout of the application I have used And Design as a component library. I have chosen this library because its implementation method seems interesting to me and it also works with LESS with which I am familiar.

I have decided to use the node package CRACO to be able to easily compile LESS.


## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
